To enable the OpenType Stylistic alternates, you need a program that supports OpenType features such 
as Adobe Illustrator CS, Adobe Indesign & CorelDraw X6-X7, Microsoft Word 2010 or later versions.
There are additional ways to access alternates/swashes, using Character Map (Windows), Nexus Font 
(Windows), Font Book (Mac) or a software program such as PopChar (for Windows and Mac).
